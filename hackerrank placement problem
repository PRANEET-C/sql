You want to find students whose best friend's salary is higher than theirs, and output the student's name, ordered by their best friend's salary.
Tables Involved:
Students(ID, Name)
Friends(ID, Friend_ID) → each student has one best friend
Packages(ID, Salary) → salary of each student (based on ID)

SELECT s.Name
FROM Students s
JOIN Friends f ON s.ID = f.ID
JOIN Packages sp ON s.ID = sp.ID          -- sp: student's package
JOIN Packages fp ON f.Friend_ID = fp.ID   -- fp: friend's package
WHERE fp.Salary > sp.Salary
ORDER BY fp.Salary;
